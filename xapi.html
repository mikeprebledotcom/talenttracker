								<h3>What is xAPI?</h3>
								<p>xAPI (Experience API) is a specification that tracks and analyzes learning experiences. It allows you to capture data about how an individual interacts with a learning experience, whether that's through an online course, a game, or a physical training session.</p>
								<p>
									One quick example of how xAPI can be used is in an online course. Imagine you have a course that teaches employees how to use a new software program. With xAPI, you can track how long each individual spends on each lesson, which parts they struggle with, and which they breeze through. This data can help you identify areas where employees may need additional support and make the course more effective.
								</p>
								<p>
									xAPI is a powerful tool that allows businesses to track and measure learning experiences in a way that was never before possible. With xAPI, companies can track learning experiences across various devices and platforms, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. </p>
									<p>For example, if a business wanted to track employee progress through a training program, it could use xAPI to capture data on how long employees spend on each lesson, what topics they struggle with, and what they excel at. This data can then be used to identify areas where employees need additional support and measure the overall effectiveness of the training program. In addition to tracking training progress, xAPI can also track other learning experiences, such as onboarding, professional development, and even team-building activities.

									<h2>Scenario: Jane learning the new CRM</h2>   
									<p>At ABC Company, Jane needed help understanding how to use the company's new customer relationship management software effectively.

									<h2>Scenario: Custom training for Sam</h2>   
									<p>Sam's manager, Taylor, has noticed that their sales numbers have decreased recently. Taylor knows that Sam needs help, but due to a busy schedule and competing priorities, Taylor has yet to have a chance to provide specific feedback and insight to Sam.
									</p>
									<p>
										Luckily, Sam and Taylor have access to the system that Talent Tracker set up and uses xAPI. As a result, they can track Sam's progress, see what skills need to be improved, and are given suggestions about what specific training will help Sam best. 
									</p>
									<p>
										By using xAPI in conjunction with a competency framework, Acme Inc. can ensure that all of their sales reps meet the necessary competencies for success and provide targeted training to help employees reach their full potential.
